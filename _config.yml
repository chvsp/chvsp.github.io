  position: He's been dabbling in improv comedy for about 5 years, doing some stuff here and thereâ€”Mumbai, Munich, Berlin. Once tried to teach improv to a flock of pigeons. They weren't impressed, but he's still trying to find his comedic wings.

  position: A former lawyer who traded his gavel for giggles after moving to Bangalore. Unsurprisingly, his favorite improv game is "Objections Only." Makes you wonder if old habits die hard or just get funnier.

- name: Akhil Harikumar

  position: An improviser, dancer and filmmaker for whom improv isn't just an art; it's the ultimate life hack. When stuck in an improv scene? He dances his way out, turning awkward pauses into comedic gold.
